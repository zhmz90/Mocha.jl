# This is an example script for training a fully connected
# network with dropout on mnist.
#
# The network size is 784-1200-1200-10 with ReLU units
# in the hidden layers and a softmax output layer.
# The parameters for training the network were chosen
# to reproduce the results from the original dropout paper:
# http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580
# and the corresponding newer JMLR paper:
# http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf
#
# Our parameters slightly differ. This is mainly due to the
# fact that in the original dropout paper the weights are scaled
# by 0.5 after training whereas we scale them by 2 during training.
#
# The settings in this script should currently produce a model that
# gets 94 errors (or 99.06 % accuracy) on the test set
# if you run it for the whole 2000 epochs (=600*2000 steps).
# This is slightly better than the results of the JMLR paper.
# This difference is likely due to slight differences in the
# learning parameters. Also note that our hyperparameters
# are not chosen using a validation set, as one would do
# for a paper. If your hardware and cuda versions differ
# from the setup we used for intial testing your results might
# also slightly vary due to floating point inaccuracies.
